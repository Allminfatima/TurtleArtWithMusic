# TurtleArtWithMusic

This project utilizes Python's `turtle` module to create colorful drawings of the word "LOVE" and integrates `pygame` to play background music. The script produces a visually appealing and interactive experience with synchronized music.

## Features

- **Colorful Drawing**: The `turtle` module is used to draw each letter of the word "LOVE" with distinct colors and styles.
- **Music Integration**: Background music is played using the `pygame` mixer to enhance the visual experience.
- **Customizable**: You can change the music file and modify the drawing as desired.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pygame` module (for playing music)
- `turtle` module (comes with Python)
